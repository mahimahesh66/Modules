This is an RDS module

*********we connect the Database engine to RDS with the help of "PG ADMIN"
and command psql -h "Rdsendpoint" -p "rds-port" -u "username" -w "database name"
mongo --host your_rds_endpoint --port your_rds_port --username your_username --password your_password --authenticationDatabase admin
aws dynamodb --region your_region --endpoint-URL https://dynamodb.your_region.amazonaws.com
MySQL -h your_rds_endpoint -P your_rds_port -u your_username -p your_database_name
